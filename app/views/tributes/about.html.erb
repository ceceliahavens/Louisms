  Go to the mirror and take a good look at yourself. ( I’ll wait )That, my friend, is the face of someone Lou Whitney deemed worthy, talented and incredibly interesting.  That is the face of someone Lou  chose to spend his time with. We were the lucky ones, and as we all know; if you were lucky enough to know Lou, you were lucky enough to love Lou.  There never has, and there never will again, be a man such as Lou Whitney. You have been chosen to stand and laugh amongst greatness, an honor bestowed on so few. 
</p>

<p>
	Lou Whitney had something so special about him. It wasn’t just his musical talent and amazing ear. His greatness went so far beyond being a musical genius; it was that of a higher evolved man. He made every person feel they were special and worthy of his undivided attention. If you were not lucky enough to be in his inner circle, you’d never feel remiss, because Lou made every man, woman and child feel like they were the most interesting person on the planet.
	</P>  

<P> Lou made us laugh (a lot), he made us think (almost as much), and he dazzled us with his stories of growing up, and growing into the music scene. Never, has there been a man who could teach you so much and make you yearn for more. Be it a riveting story about how to make an easy chair, (somehow it was riveting?) to a gentle nudge as he said “Just think for a minute.”  He  captured that  childlike wonder in all of us. </p> 

<P>In theory, this book of Louisms is just a small token to remember him by, or to help you get through the loss of such a legend.  In reality it may just be one small way a friend pays her last respects to a man she adored. </P> 

<P>Grief is a tricky business, and one that must be endured. There is no shortcut around it, only a direct path through it. My heart breaks for my own personal loss but equally breaks knowing the sadness that has fallen on my friends, my community and those I have never had the honor to meet. We shared something beautiful and we are forever linked by the legacy of Lou Whitney.</P>
